# Todo App With Firebase

A Flutter Project where I used Firebase authentication to authenticate user,
SQLite local database to store Todo list
Dio package to fetch and read REST API blog data
and finally Flutter Stripe to Payment Integration.

## Getting Started

#### Step 1:
User can register or login or logout via Firebase Authentication. 

#### Step 2:
User can store, read, write or delete todo task in the mobile local storage via SQLite database.

#### Step 3:
User can read blog data from a generated Rest API through jsonplaceholder. 

#### Step 4:
User can perform payment via Flutter Stripe.
